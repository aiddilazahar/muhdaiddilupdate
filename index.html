<p>Assalamualaikum and welcome to my personal website. First, my name is Muhammad Aiddil Bin Azahar.
My purpose to create personal website is to provide information about my life which contains my profile,
education, family, experience, gallery and some other information.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides, I want to thanks to my Introduction To Web Content Management & Design lecturer, Sir Mohd Firdaus Bin Mohd Helmi who is responsible for teaching me this subject in this semester. He always explaining
theories and shows us tutorials of how to put elements that can contribute to completion of website in term of criteria.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Elements that Sir Mohd Firdaus have been teach this semester is basic HTML structure, font,
images, hyperlinks, lists, tables, multimedia and cascading stylesheet. These elements is necessary to be included when creating website because its contents must be 
provided in various shapes. If a website were just providing texts only, it will not be accessed by users because there are no specific information
can be obtained and users would prefer interesting and effective website.
